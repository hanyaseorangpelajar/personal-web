            <p>
            Hello everybody! üëã
            <br>
            My name is Adri and I‚Äôm just starting third year of my Computer Science studies at Diponegoro University.
            <br>
            Now I am one of the Google Developer Student Clubs core team as a program developer.
            <br>
            Currently I am more interested in front end or backend web development.
            <br>
            Love what Github started doing for students and so much effort they are putting into it.
            Don‚Äôt hesitate to shoot me an email!</p>

            <h1>HMIF Logo Classifier</h1>
            <p>As a computer science student and a member of HMIF, I was interested in developing a machine learning model that can recognize the organization's logo in images. After learning about image classification techniques and using Python and the TensorFlow library, I created a program that can take an image file as input and output a prediction whether it contains the HMIF logo or not.</p>

            <h1>APIMAS</h1>
            <p>APIMAS is an on going collaborative web app project designed for college students to share their aspirations, critiques, stories, comments, and more. The project is led by Bhaska, a talented front-end developer, and I, Adri, serve as the backend developer.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As the backend developer, my responsibilities include designing and maintaining the database, creating APIs for Bhaska to consume, and ensuring the overall security and scalability of the platform. I work closely with Bhaska to integrate features and ensure a smooth user experience for our target audience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Bhaska, on the other hand, is responsible for creating an intuitive and engaging front-end design that captures the essence of our project. He works closely with me to ensure that the design and functionality of the platform align, resulting in a seamless user experience.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Together, we are committed to creating a platform that serves the needs of college students, providing them with a space to share their experiences and connect with others who share similar aspirations. We are excited to bring APIMAS to life and make a positive impact on the college community.</p>
